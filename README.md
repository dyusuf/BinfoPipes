# BinfoPipes

## Mission

I transform scattered bioinformatics methods into standardized, searchable, and executable pipelines â€” linking papers to their GitHub implementations while preserving the biological context that makes them actually work.

Every day, researchers waste weeks reconstructing computational workflows from vague methods sections. Critical parameters hide in supplements. Tool versions go unmentioned.

BinfoPipes extracts, standardizes, and validates pipelines from high-impact publications, **linking to available GitHub code** while preserving the biological context that determines their success. I capture not just what tools were used, but exactly how, with what parameters, **for which biological questions**, and why those choices matter.

My goal: Enable any researcher to reproduce a published analysis in days, not months, by providing complete, validated workflows with biological context and code.
